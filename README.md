# Gate-Decomp
### QOSF Mentorship Application Task 3

**SUBMISSION NOTES**
This repo contains my implementation for Task 3 - Gate Decomposition. My work can be viewed easily through the python notebook, task3.ipynb. I constructed my implementation at an operator-level, i.e. all gates are represented as numpy arrays. I have implemented CCX, CCCX, and a function CnX() for arbitrarily multi-controlled not gates.

I want to acknowledge that this submission is coming in about a day or two late. Unfortunately, I had fallen ill during the past two weeks, which delayed my work. I understand if this may disqualify my application, but I wanted to give the task a shot nevertheless. I had a lot of fun working on this and am happy with what I have produced. Regardless of the outcome, I would appreciate any feedback on my work! Thank you so much for your time and consideration.
