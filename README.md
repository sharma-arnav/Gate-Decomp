# Gate-Decomp
### QOSF Mentorship Application Task 3

This repo contains my implementation for Task 3 - Gate Decomposition, part of the application for the QOSF Mentorship program. My work can be viewed easily through the python notebook, task3.ipynb. I constructed my implementation at an operator-level, i.e. all gates are represented as numpy arrays. I have implemented CCX, CCCX, and a function CnX() for arbitrarily multi-controlled not gates. I had a lot of fun working on this and would appreciate any feedback on my work!
